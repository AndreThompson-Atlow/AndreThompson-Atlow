Welcome to my Github Profile!

My name is Andre Thompson and i'm a Fullstack Javascript Developer. I have a passion for solving problems, watching anime and writing code. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular. I'm pretty solid when it comes to React, so I decided to branch out and learn Angular. So far it's not too difficult-- but I sort of hate the syntax. I mean, putting javascript lines in quotation marks? No thanks! I do love the Typescript support though. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on remaking my Password Saver app, but with better React code. I wrote that code before I was good at using hooks and functional based components. This version is going to look a lot better-- I promise.
